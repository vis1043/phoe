                    <p><b>Karnataka</b><br/>
                        Recent floods in Karnataka have caused significant damage and disruption. The Krishna River has overflowed due to heavy monsoon rains, particularly affecting the Belagavi, Raichur, and Bagalkot districts. Thousands of families have been relocated to relief centers, and numerous bridges and roads have been submerged. In Belagavi alone, over 500 houses have been damaged, and crops in approximately 26,674 hectares have been destroyed【14†source】【15†source】.
                        
                        The situation is dire with five reported fatalities since the onset of the monsoon. The local administration has been actively setting up relief centers and diverting traffic from flooded routes. The state government is focusing on rescue and relief operations, particularly in the hardest-hit areas like Gokak, where flooding had submerged many parts of the town over the weekend【14†source】【15†source】.

                        <br/><br/><b>Maharashtra</b><br/>
                        In Maharashtra, the flooding situation is closely tied to the release of water from state dams into the Krishna River, which flows into Karnataka. This has led to increased water levels and the threat of flash floods in northern Karnataka regions. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely, as heavy rainfall continues to impact various districts【13†source】【14†source】.
                        
                        Both states are working to mitigate the impact, but the continuous rains pose ongoing challenges. Efforts are being made to support affected communities, ensure their safety, and begin the recovery process as soon as possible.<br/>

                    <p>On July 30, 2024, severe landslides triggered by heavy rains struck Wayanad district in Kerala, resulting in over 300 fatalities and numerous missing persons. The landslides affected several villages, including Punjirimattom, Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, Meppadi, and Kunhome. The rescue operations have been extensive, with around 600 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams and over 1,500 personnel from the Indian Armed Forces deployed to the area. Despite the challenging conditions, more than 4,000 people have been rescued, and over 10,000 individuals have been relocated to relief camps【6†source】【7†source】.
                        <br/><br/><b>Political and Relief Efforts</b><br/>
The Wayanad landslides have sparked political discussions, with Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, urging the central government to declare the event a national disaster. However, the government has stated that there is no legal provision for declaring a natural disaster as a national disaster. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the affected areas to assess the situation and oversee relief efforts【6†source】.
