                <p>"During the heavy rains and floods in Bangalore in recent years, it was evident how unprepared the city was. Roads were inundated, and many areas faced severe waterlogging. The emergency services were overwhelmed and slow to respond. Better urban planning and drainage systems are essential."</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>India's disaster preparedness is still lacking. The recent cyclones have shown that despite advances in weather forecasting, the response systems are often chaotic. Communities are not equipped with the necessary resources or training to handle these emergencies effectively."</p>

                    <p>"I have experienced mild earthquakes and floods but they didn’t give me a nightmarish time like a cyclone did. I’m talking about the Fani cyclone which made it’s landfall near the coast of Puri, Odisha.

                        Having lived out my childhood away from the coastal districts of Odisha, I had heard only stories about the Odisha Super Cyclone of 1999 and the destruction it had left behind in it’s wake causing the death of almost 10,000."

But in reality this is not the case, and we continue to be in the relief-centric mode."One way environmentalists believe this could be improved is if evacuated people had safe structures on firm ground and not in flood plains; something authorities have not been able to ensure.</P>

                    <h2>Mohanty of IITR Explains:</h2>
                    <p>“Disastrous floods seriously threaten agricultural production and affect their livelihood. India suffered huge crop loss on 18.2 million hectares of land, roughly 8.5% of the total gross cropped area, due to floods from 2017-2019”.  These floods lead to “a reduction in agricultural production, which weakens the farmer’s purchasing power and decreases their employment opportunities”, which, in turn, leads to “serious threats of poverty, hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition” for them and their families.</p>
